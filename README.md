# html5 Game Quintus js / Angular js
 HTML5 Game made with Quintus js integrated in  Angular js

The first challenge of this is the integration of 3rd party java script library Quintus.js with Angular.js
Then I load some JSON objects with angular $http service to Quintus assets, all of that with  rest API made with node.js / Loopback / mongodb
